# Decompiled android driver for MS9120 usb - cvbs adapter 
Fully decompiled version of MS9120 graphics card driver that I worked on for a while to make it build. I didn't have time to clean it up (but it was written in java initially so it is already pretty good).
Feel free to use it for your project (for example, you might want to make some kind of AV video player or hud - that was my idea initially)

# Warning
Not tested yet. Don't have an adapter on my hands atm

# Tools used for decompilation
* jadx
* apktool
